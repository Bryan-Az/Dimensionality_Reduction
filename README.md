# Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality Reduction, visualization of reduced and embedded, clustered data, as well as hyper-parameter tuning. Further, using automated system data bricks.

There will be three notebooks produced. 

1) Dimensionality reduction on it's own on various sets of data. Techniques applied include:

    a) PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE
   
    b) UMAP and t-sne 

2) Dimensionality reduction followed by clustering on the same sets of data as used in notebook 1.
   - Specifically, UMAP will be used clustering.

3) Dimensionality reduction using data bricks.
